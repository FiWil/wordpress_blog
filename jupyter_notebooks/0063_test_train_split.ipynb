    "To test the accuracy of a model we will test the model on data that it has not seen before. We will divide available data into two sets: a training set that the model will learn from, and a test set which will be used to test the accuracy of the model on new data. A convenient way to split the data is to use scikit-learn's train_test_split method. This randomly divides the data between training and test sets. We may specify what propoprtion to keep for the test set (0.2 - 0.3 is common)."
