# # Tuples
# 
# Tuples are like lists in many ways, apart from they cannot be changed - they are <em>immutable</em>. Tuples are defined used curved brackets (unlike square brackets for lists). Tuples may be returned, or be required, by various functions in Python, and tuples may be chosen where <em>immutability</em> would be an advantage (for example, to help prevent accidental changes). 

# ## Creating and adding to tuples

# In[16]:


my_tuple = ('Hobbit','Elf','Ork','Dwarf')
print (my_tuple[1])


# It is possible to add to a tuple. Note that if adding a single item an additional comma is used to indicate to Python that the variable being added is a tuple.

# In[17]:


my_tuple = my_tuple + ('Man',)
my_tuple += ('Wizard','Balrog') # Note that the += is short hand to add something to itslef
print (my_tuple)


# It is not possible to change or delete an item in a tuple. To change or delete a tuple a new tuple must be built (but if this is going to happen then a list would be a better choice).

# In[18]:


my_new_tuple = my_tuple[0:2] + ('Goblin',) + my_tuple[4:] # The 4: is a slice from index 4 to end
print (my_new_tuple)


# ## Converting between tuples and lists, and sorting tuples

# A tuple may be turned into a list. We can recognise that it is a list by the square brackets.

# In[20]:


my_list = list(my_tuple)
print (my_list)


# A list may also be converter into a tuple.

# In[28]:


my_list.sort()
my_new_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print (my_new_tuple)


# In the above example we sorted a list and converted it to a tuple. Tuples cannot be changed (apart from being added to), so it is not possible to directly sort a tuple. The <em>sorted</em> command will act on a tuple to sort it, but returns a list.

# In[29]:


print (sorted(my_tuple))


# The tuple may be sorted by converting back to a list in a single step (but think of using lists, rather than tuples, is sorting will be common.

# In[32]:


my_tuple = tuple(sorted(my_tuple))
print (my_tuple)
